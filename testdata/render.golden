<p>Some post to demonstrate how posts will work in jrnl. This will also be used to test the core functionality of jrnl too, such as markdown formatting, and front matter unmarshalling. Posts use markdown for rendering, so you can have <em>italics</em>, <strong>bold</strong>, <code>code</code>, and much more to make a post more rich in appearance.</p>

<p>The first line of this post will be used as the post&rsquo;s preview. In each index of the journal the post&rsquo;s preview will be displayed, beneath the post&rsquo;s title, and created at time.</p>

<p>Front matter will be at the beginning of each post and contain meta-data about the post. The front matter will be used to determine which layout should be used when rendering the post, along with the title of the post, whether or not it should be indexed, and the timestamps.</p>

<p>This post should now be long enough to used for testing.</p>
