Files in the `testdata` directory are used for unit testing jrnl. These files will serve to partially emulate a jrnl directory, and hopefully demonstrate how posts, pages, and categories work in jrnl. Files with the `.golden` suffix are used for comparing complex strings that are output during the tests. This saves having to place this data inside the test code itself.
