<p>Files in the <code>testdata</code> directory are used for unit testing jrnl. These files will serve to partially emulate a jrnl directory, and hopefully demonstrate how posts, pages, and categories work in jrnl. Files with the <code>.golden</code> suffix are used for comparing complex strings that are output during the tests. This saves having to place this data inside the test code itself.</p>
