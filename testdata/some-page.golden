<p>Some page to demonstrate how pages will work in jrnl. This will also be used to test the core functionality of jrnl too, such as markdown formatting, and front matter unmarshalling. Posts use markdown for rendering, so you can have <em>italics</em>, <strong>bold</strong>, <code>code</code>, and much more to make a page more rich in appearance.</p>

<p>Front matter will be at the beginning of each page and contain meta-data about the page. The front matter will be used to determine which layout should be used when rendering the page, along with the title of the page, whether or not it should be indexed, and the timestamps.</p>

<p>This page should now be long enough to used for testing.</p>
