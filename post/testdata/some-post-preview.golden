Some post to demonstrate how posts will work in jrnl. This will also be used to test the core functionality of jrnl too, such as markdown formatting, and front matter unmarshalling. Posts use markdown for rendering, so you can have *italics*, **bold**, `code`, and much more to make a post more rich in appearance.
